### PLANS FOR CHARTERSITE
---
##### Main goals
1. RESTful API that handles google calendar event creation and deletion
2. Use STRIPE for processing payments
3. Fills db with charters already done and to be done
---
**Google Calendar API** \n
The goal is to have a restful api that can handle all event creation,
display of all current events on the calendar, updates to events and deletions.

**STRIPE API** \n
Incorporate stripe to allow for online payment of charters.
Event creation on the google calendar should only be allowed once a successful payment has gone through.

**CHARTER DB** \n
Maintain a log of captains, boats, passengers, payment methods and charters.
